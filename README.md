# Morse-Code
This Contains my python program to encrypt messages (string) into morse code and vise versa

Inside this repository you will just one python program and a jpg file of the morse code.
Fork this repository and you can use this program to create some encrypted code language and send it to friends 

How the program works :

Inititially when you call the program it asks us to input 1 or 2 , which corresponds to Encrypt a message or Decode a message respectively

if you chose 1 , Next you need to enter the message that you want to encrypt ; And you will get the message as an output as well as the "The message would be automatically copied to your clipboard so no need to worry about selecting and copying"


Note : Do not use punctuation marks or any symbols in your message (this support will be added in the future versions)

if you chose 2 , Then you would have to input the morse code 

Note : while entering the morse code use " " a single whitespace to seperate each letters and "  " double white space to seperate words , the program is written to distinguish each words like that.
